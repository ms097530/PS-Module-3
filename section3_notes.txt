- 'public' directory is for static files
  - meaning unchanging (i.e. static CSS or JS, images, ...)
  - dynamic files change depending on data

  - two possible MERN project structures
    1. two separate projects, one for frontend, one for backend
      - pros
        - better for when backend services multiple frontend projects (web, native mobile, desktop)
      - cons
        - must manage two projects and repos
        - must deploy two separate projects
        - React project will require code and/or configuration to access correct backend during development (localhost) and production (could be anywhere)
        - must implement CORS
    2. integrated frontend and backend
      - pros
        - single integrated project
        - none of the above cons
      - cons
        - not the best structure for reusing the same backend to service multiple frontend projects (e.g. web/mobile/desktop)

- Types of modules
  - UTILITY - hold general purpose functions, reusable in multiple projects
  - SERVICE - organize app specific logic (i.e. functions for signing up or logging in a user); often use and depend on API modules
  - API modules - abstracting logic that makes requests (such as AJAX calls); abstraction makes it easier to refactor code to use different techniques, libraries, etc. (i.e. using fetch, but refactoring to axios would be easy thanks to API modules)
