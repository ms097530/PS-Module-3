Section 2 Notes

Intro to Node

- Electron to build cross-platform desktop apps with JS, HTML, and CSS

- why is Node so performant?
  - asynchronous/event-driven design enables non-blocking input-output
  - typical Node server is capable of supporting tens of thousands of concurrent connections

Asynchronous Programming Model
- high performance, non-blocking I/O operations must be designed as asynchronous methods
  - therefore, Node developer will use callback functions and/or promises extensively
** try/catch should be handled within callback in Node, can not throw outside
